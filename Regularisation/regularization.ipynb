    "# Regularization\n",
    "    Regularization helps to solve over fitting problem in machine learning. Simple model will be a very poor generalization of data. At the same time, complex model may not perform well in test data due to over fitting. We need to choose the right model in between simple and complex model. Regularization helps to choose preferred model complexity, so that model is better at predicting. Regularization is nothing but adding a penalty term to the objective function and control the model complexity using that penalty term. It can be used for many machine learning algorithms."
