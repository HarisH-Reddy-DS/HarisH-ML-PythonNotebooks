# HarisH-ML-PythonNotebooks
A Statistics postgraduate, a data science enthusiast. I love to see how the power of data analysis and machine learning techniques are solving the world's most critical issuses.


 In this repo I working on various Machine Learning Algorithms.\n i) Classification Algorithms a)Logistic Regression b)SVM(Support Vector Machine) c)Decision Trees d)KNN(K-Nearest Neighbours) e)Random Forests f)Naive Bayes and Various Algorithms ii)Prediction Algorithms a)Discriminant Analysis(Linear,Fixed,Regularised,Quadratic) b)CART(Classification and Regression Trees) c)PART(Probability and Regression Trees) d)C4.5 e)Random Forest Tree Regession and various methods. iii)Clustering/segmentation Algorithms a)K-Means Clustering b)Appriori Algorithm

Requirements: 1.Jupyter Notebook 2.Python Packages i)Numpy ii)Pandas iii)Matplotlib iv)Seaborn v)Sci-Kit learn(SkLearn) Machine learning

My mantra "Train Test Train Test Maximize Accuracy Minimize Noise"
